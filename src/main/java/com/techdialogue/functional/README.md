Functional ==> 
Higher order functions and  immutability, 
Functional composition, Lazy evaluation

Ideally No Exceptions in Functional programming


InvokeDynamic ==> for dynamically typed languages on JVM
Lambdas are invoked using them and no classes are created for Lambdas
Don't use big lambdas create a separate method and use Method reference for invocation
